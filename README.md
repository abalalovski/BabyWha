BabyWha is a mobile app that helps you find missing groceries for your baby from your surrounding neighbors.

## Why is it open source?

This is a live project that I play with in my spare time. I want to showcase my skills and promote my Flutter knowledge to different level. Eventually it should become a fully functional app that solves the real problem, but in general it's just a mean for better learning. 

## Technical details

The implementation is in Flutter (woah!) and fully cross-platform. The initial idea is to get it released for both Android and iOS. 
It utilizes mobx as a library for state management and Firebase as database and authentication service. At this point there is no binding between Firestore and the app but things will follow and come to a point Firestore is used completely as database.
